Implementations demonstrating Supervised Learning on Adaptive Systems

**DESCRIPTION**
- Trains a Decision Tree Classifier on the Iris dataset for flower species prediction. - Explores data with Pandas/Seaborn, splits train/test, evaluates with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix. Visualizes the tree.

  **KEY OUTPUTS**
  - Confusion matrix shows perfect separation for most classes.
